# CodeConnect 

CodeConnect is a social media platform developed for coders using the MERN stack. üë®‚Äçüíª

## To get started

To get started, you will need to clone the repository or download the code. Next, create a MongoDB database and link it to the application. An example .env file has been provided to guide you in this process. Once that is done, navigate to the server folder, uncomment the 3 imports and add data one time parts in the index.js file.

To add dummy data to your MongoDB, run "npm run start" or "node index.js" in the server folder.

## Launching for registration

To launch the application, navigate to the client folder and execute "npm run start" in a separate terminal. This will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

After registration, you will have access to your personalized login credentials that will sync with your MongoDB and give you access to all the available dummy data.

## Customisation

CodeConnect can be customised by changing the application name, adding more data or launching on hosting platforms like [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/login) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). I have tested and recommend these two platforms for hosting MERN applications.

There are ofcourse other sites, but those two are my favourite for MERN applications so far.
